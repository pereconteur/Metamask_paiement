# Metamask online paiement with cryptocurrencies

I have created this repository to help those who want to integrate cryptocurrency payments, via Metamask, on their website.

The code is essentially in the file "metamask.js". You can use this code as you wish, improve it and/or modify it to your liking. 

## Usage

Retrieve the deposit : 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pereconteur/Metamask_paiement
